/**
  * Implementation of "Connect Four" (cf. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four Wikipedia: Connect Four]])
  * using the minimax algorithm as the foundation for the implementation of the artificial intelligence.
  * (More precisely, the negamax algorithm, which is a variant of the minimax algorithm, is implemented.)
  *
  * ==Relevant Classes==
  * The game logic is implemented by the class [[de.tud.cs.stg.connect4.ConnectFourGame]] which is
  * independent of any specific user interface.
  *
  * A basic command-line interface is implemented by the class [[de.tud.cs.stg.connect4.ui.CLI]].
  *
  * ==Implementation==
  * In general, care was taken to make sure that the implementation is reasonably efficient w.r.t. the
  * memory usage as well as the overall runtime performance. To that end, the complete game state is encoded
  * using two long values. The encoding was done such that is efficient to check for lines of four connected
  * men as well as to update the game state.
  *
  * To make the code more comprehensible value classes are used to indicate in which way a particular long
  * value is used.
